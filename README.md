# 3D-Geometry-Processing

Contains:

1. Implementation of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm with some variations.
2. Major classes for Laplacian filtering in the context of mesh denoising. Involved in this is:
      - the computation of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Laplace-Beltrami operator)
      - implicit and explicit Laplacian mesh smoothing
      - evaluation of performance of Laplacian mesh denoising in the context of data smoothing
